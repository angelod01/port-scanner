# Basic Network Port Scanner

## Description
This project is a simple TCP port scanner designed to identify open ports on specified hosts. It supports scanning single IP addresses or domain names within a specified port range. The scanner uses multi-threading for faster scanning and provides verbose output for detailed scanning information. It also supports saving the scan results to a JSON file.

## Features
- Multi-threaded TCP port scanning for improved speed  
- Scans individual IP addresses or hostnames  
- Port range scanning with support for all ports (1-65535)  
- Input validation for target IP addresses
- Detect known vulnerabilities for specific servers (FTP, SSH, etc..)
- Verbose mode for detailed output  
- Save scan results to a JSON file  
- Color-coded output to easily identify open and closed ports  

---

## Libraries
- Standard libraries: `socket`, `threading`, `argparse`, `json`, `ipaddress`  
- External libraries: `tqdm` for progress bars, `termcolor` for colored terminal output, `IPython` for clearing output in Jupyter environments

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher  
- Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/angelod01/port-scanner.git
```

```bash
cd port-scanner
```

## Usage
### Command Line Arguments
| Argument              | Description                                                               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-t`, `--targets`     | Required. One or more IPs or domains to scan.                            |
| `-p`, `--port-range`  | Optional. Port range like `1-100` or `all` (default: `1-100`).            |
| `-T`, `--timeout`     | Optional. Timeout in seconds per scan attempt (default: `1.0`).          |
| `-n`, `--num-threads` | Optional. Number of concurrent threads (default: `10`).                  |
| `-o`, `--output`      | Optional. Save results to a file in JSON format.                         |
| `-v`, `--verbose`     | Optional. Verbose output during scan.                                    |

### Examples
Scan a single IP over default port range (1â€“100):
```bash
python main.py -t 192.168.1.1
```
Scan a domain over a custom port range:
```bash
python main.py -t example.com -p 20-80
```
Scan multiple targets:
```bash
python main.py -t 192.168.1.1 10.0.0.1 example.com
```
Scan all ports on a target with verbose output:
```bash
python main.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p all -v
```
Use 50 threads and set a longer timeout:
```bash
python main.py -t example.com -p 1-1024 -n 50 -T 3.0
```
Save scan results to a JSON file:
```bash
python main.py -t 10.0.0.1 -p 22-25 -o results.json
```

## Known Issues
- Service detection may fail if the server does not respond to banner grabbing.
- Some ports may appear closed due to firewalls or filtering mechanisms.
- Accuracy of vulnerability detection is limited to basic banner checks.

Use this tool responsibly and only on systems you have permission to scan.
